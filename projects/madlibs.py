This program generates passages that are generated in mad-lib format
Author: Katherin 

In this project, we'll use Python to write a Mad Libs word game! Mad Libs have short stories with blank spaces that a player can fill in. The result is usually funny (or strange).

Mad Libs require:

    A short story with blank spaces (asking for different types of words).
    Words from the player to fill in those blanks.


"Roses are Red" poem example


For this project, we have provided the story, but it will be up to you to complete the following:

    1. Prompt the user for inputs.
    2. Print the story with the inputs in the right places.

Let's begin!
