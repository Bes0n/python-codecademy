Rock, Paper, Scissors

<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>In this project, we'll build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock-Paper-Scissors</a>!</p>
<p>The program should do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.</li>
<li>Instruct the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.</li>
<li>Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice.</li>
<li>Determine a winner (the user or the computer).</li>
<li>Inform the user who the winner is.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
