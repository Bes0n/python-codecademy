In this project, we'll build Rock-Paper-Scissors!

The program should do the following:

1. Prompt the user to select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. Instruct the computer to randomly select either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. Compare the user's choice and the computer's choice.
4. Determine a winner (the user or the computer).
5. Inform the user who the winner is.

Happy coding!
