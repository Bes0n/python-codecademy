## RGB-HEX Converter

<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>In this project, we'll use Bitwise operators to build a calculator that can convert <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model" target="_blank">RGB values</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank">Hexadecimal (hex) values</a>, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>We'll add three methods to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>A method to convert RGB to Hex</li>
<li>A method to convert Hex to RGB</li>
<li>A method that starts the prompt cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>The program should do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prompt the user for the type of conversion they want</li>
<li>Ask the user to input the RGB or Hex value</li>
<li>Use Bitwise operators and shifting in order to convert the value</li>
<li>Print the converted value to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>It's useful to know some background on RGB and hex values, so we recommend reading the resources we linked to.</p>
<p>Note: As with professional software development, you should be saving your code very often. As you code, make sure you click the "Save" button below to save your code/changes. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing all your code.</p>
