## Bank Account
<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>In this project, we'll create a Python class that can be used to create and manipulate a personal bank account.</p>
<p>The bank account class you'll create should have methods for each of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accepting deposits</li>
<li>Allowing withdrawals</li>
<li>Showing the balance</li>
<li>Showing the details of the account</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: As with professional software development, you should be saving your code very often. As you code, make sure you click the "Save" button below to save your code/changes. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing all your code!</p>
<p>Let's begin!</p>
<p> If you get stuck during this project, check out the <strong>project walkthrough video</strong> which can be found at the bottom of the page after the final step of the project.</p>
