## DNA Analysis
<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>In this project, we'll use many of the concepts you've learned throughout the Python course in order to do some DNA analysis for a crime investigation.</p>
<p>The scenario:</p>
<p>A spy deleted important files from a computer. There were a few witnesses at the scene of the crime, but no one is sure who exactly the spy was. Three possible suspects were apprehended based on surveillance video. Each suspect had a sample of DNA taken from them. The computer's keyboard was also swabbed for DNA evidence and, luckily, one small DNA sample was successfully retrieved from the computer's keyboard.</p>
<p>Given the three suspects' DNA and the sample DNA retreived from the keyboard, it's up to you to figure out who the spy is!</p>
<p>The project should have methods for each of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given a file, read in the DNA for each suspect and save it as a string</li>
<li>Take a DNA string and split it into a list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_codon_table" target="_blank">codons</a></li>
<li>Iterate through a suspect's codon list to see how many of their codons match the sample codons</li>
<li>Pick the right suspect to continue the investigation on</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: As with professional software development, you should be saving your code very often. As you code, make sure you click the "Save" button below to save your code/changes. Otherwise, you run the risk of losing all your code!</p>
<p>Let's begin!</p>
<p>If you get stuck during this project, check out the <strong>project walkthrough video</strong> which can be found at the bottom of the page after the final step of the project.</p>
