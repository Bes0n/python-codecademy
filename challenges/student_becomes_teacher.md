## STUDENT BECOMES THE TEACHER

### Lesson Number One
<p>Welcome to this "Challenge Course". Until now we've been leading you by the hand and working on some short and relatively easy projects. This is a <strong>challenge</strong> so be ready. We have faith in you!</p>
<p>Weâ€™re going to switch it up a bit and allow you to be the teacher of your own class. Make a gradebook for all of your students.</p>

```python
animal = {
  "name": "Mr. Fluffles",
  "sounds": ["meow", "purr"]
}
print animal["name"]
```

<p>The example above is just to remind you how to create a dictionary and then to access the item stored by the <code>"name"</code> key.</p>

###### LESSON
<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>Create three dictionaries: <code>lloyd</code>, <code>alice</code>, and <code>tyler</code>.  </p>
<p>Give each dictionary the keys <code>"name"</code>, <code>"homework"</code>, <code>"quizzes"</code>, and <code>"tests"</code>.  </p>
<p>Have the "name" key be the name of the student (that is, <code>lloyd</code>'s name should be <code>"Lloyd"</code>) and the other keys should be an empty list (We'll fill in these lists soon!)</p>
</div>
