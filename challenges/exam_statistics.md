## Exam Statistics
### Let's look at those grades!
<div class="theme__22QeW-d-YRjfwg7z9oiZH_"><p>Creating a program to compute statistics means that you won't have to whip out your calculator and manually crunch numbers. All you'll have to do is supply a new set of numbers and our program does all of the hard work. </p>
<p>This mini-project will give you some practice with functions, lists, and translating mathematical formulae into programming statements.</p>
<p>In order to use the scores in our program, we'll need them in a container, namely a list.</p>
<p>On the right, you'll see the grades <em>listed</em> (see what I did there). The data is anonymous to protect the privacy of the students. </p>
